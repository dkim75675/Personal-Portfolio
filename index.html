                    Hello to any who are interested. My name is Dong Kim and I am 30 years old. I have worked a variety of different jobs before I decided
                    to get a degree in biochemistry and molecular biology. Before beginning my journey into coding, I was at an environmental lab. But 
                    during the pandemic, I decided to shift my career goals towards coding. This was due to the difficulties I experienced at the lab during that 
                    time as well as after speaking to my previous professors about what would be a good career move going forward. After some introspection and thorough
                    research, I finally decided on enrolling in the self paced program offered by coding temple. I am still working full time at wing store that my younger
                    brother and I are running while aiming to complete the program by April 9th.

            <div class="order-1 p-3 container-sm">
                <h1 class="d-flex justify-content-center">Hobbies</h1>
                Majority of my hobbies are centered around physical activities where I am constantly able to grow and get better at. This includes hiking, camping,
                weightlifting and brazlian jiu-jitsu(aka bjj). After highschool is when I really began focusing on weightlifting specifically powerlifting. During that 
                time I was focused on gettting as strong in order to do well in competitions. But as I older, I realized that powerlifting was taking a toll on my body
                which made me look towards a new hobby. My friend a few years ago introduced me to bjj. I was completely destroyed by the end of the first class. Everybody 
                (and I literally mean everbody) that I rolled with made me feel like a toddler as I was getting submitted over and over again. Needless to say that I was 
                instantly hooked. I was fascinated by how peoplesmaller and weaker than me, were able to easily move from position to position and found openings to exploit. 
                It was like playing human chess, just with more dire consequences. I have continued to train for two years straight, and am hoping that I can continue to learn
                and grow for as long as I am able.
